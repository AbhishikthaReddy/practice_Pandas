#Work Area for practicing Pandas

This is my repo for practicing, learning and demonstrating data munging/processing concepts using Pandas. I will likely use some of this content to create blog posts (if I come up with something interesting) to share what I've learnt. 

Feel free to use this for your own reference or learning. Just clone the repo or download the .ipynb files. The IPython notebooks can also be viewed online below:
